#Active Directory SSO for Meteor

Active Directory Single Sign On Authentication and Authorization for Meteor.

This module contains two parts. One runs inside a Microsoft IIS server, using
[iisnode](https://github.com/tjanczuk/iisnode). The other is a Meteor smart package,
which provides a login handler.

###[IIS component](iisnode-meteor-ad-sso)

The other is a Meteor smart package.
